A firebase app project that I did not have the time to continue.
Set up following the docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup
Authentication does not work. But attempted to follow: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start

Firebese requires a much more involved setup than just implementing Authentication.
